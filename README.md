# Species Delimitation Tutorials

The present repository contains tutorials on species delimitation algorithms that were created in the framework of the workshop ["ForBio course: Species Concepts and Species Delimitation, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"](http://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2016/Species%20delimitation)


Coordinator: [Maria Capa](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/maria.capa) â€“ ForBio.

Teachers: [Timothy Barraclough](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.barraclough), Imperial College of London; [Joan Pons](http://imedea.uib-csic.es/ficha.php?pid=638&c=pub), Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA), Balearic Islands; [Paschalia Kapli](http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/people.html), Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies.


# Brief Description

In the [Wiki](https://github.com/Pas-Kapli/tutorials/wiki) there are step by step tutorials for three distance-based ([ABGD](http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/), [Vsearch](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch), [Crop](https://github.com/tingchenlab)) and two tree-based ([GMYC](https://tmfujis.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/how-to-run-gmyc/), [mPTP](https://github.com/Pas-Kapli/mptp)) delimitation methods.

We use two datasets for all exercises:

1. 57 cytochrome b sequences of the Branchiomma worms of the [Sabellidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabellidae) family. The data were retrieved from the corresponding [publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zsc.12028/abstract).

2. 517 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences of the genus [Carabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabus). The sequences of this datasets were retrieved from the [BOLD](http://www.barcodinglife.org/) database, and they were filtered for sequences of problematic species definition.

The input and output files are provided along each tutorial. Additionally, all files, pre-compiled software binaries and auxiliary scripts can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Pas-Kapli/assets). 

The broad task of the tutorials is described [here](https://github.com/Pas-Kapli/tutorials/wiki/Task)
