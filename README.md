# Species delimitation Tutorials

The present repository contains tutorials on species delimitation algorithms that were created in the framework of the workshop ["ForBio course: Species Concepts and Species Delimitation, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"](http://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2016/Species%20delimitation)


Coordinator: [Maria Capa](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/maria.capa) â€“ ForBio.

Teachers: [Timothy Barraclough](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.barraclough), Imperial College of London; [Joan Pons](http://imedea.uib-csic.es/ficha.php?pid=638&c=pub), Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA), Balearic Islands, [Paschalia Kapli](http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/people.html), Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies   


# Description of tutorials

In the [Wiki](https://github.com/Pas-Kapli/tutorials/wiki) there are step by step tutorial for three distance-based ([ABGD](http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/), [Vsearch](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch), [Crop](https://github.com/tingchenlab)) and two tree-based ([GMYC](https://tmfujis.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/how-to-run-gmyc/), [mPTP](https://github.com/Pas-Kapli/mptp)) 

We use two datasets for all the tutorials:
1. Cytochrome b sequences of the Branchiomma worms of the [Sabellidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabellidae) family. The data were retrieved from the corresponding [publication](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zsc.12028/abstract)
2. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences of the genus [Carabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabus). The sequences of this datasets were retrieved from the [BOLD](http://www.barcodinglife.org/) database, and they were filtered for sequences of problematic species definition.

All input and output files, as described in the tutorials, are included in the data folder of the repository. Binary, pre-compiled executables and auxillary scripts are also included in the misc folder of the data folder.
